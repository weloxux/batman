# batman
batman (short for battery manager, pun totally not intended) is a tiny utility to give you a nicer way to display battery percentages in a terminal. It is well-documented and very efficient (in fact, this code could be put in three lines without any disadvantages, except for lack of readability).

## Installation
Slap the file called batman in either /usr/local/bin (recommended) or /usr/bin (if you do not have the former). Run `sudo chmod +x batman` in the folder you placed it, and you should be able to access the command batman

## License
